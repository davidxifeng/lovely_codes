-- | This script wraps clang to pass it essential arguments that keep it from dying when
-- GHC uses it as a C pre-processor during the build process.
-- To use it, choose the version of clang you'd like to use, 
-- (GHC-iOS needs to use Xcode5's clang, which is already set here)
-- then compile it (ghc clang-xcode5-wrapper.hs).
-- Then, find your GHC settings file (usually something like /usr/local/lib/ghc-7.6.3/settings)
-- and change the "C compiler command" to point to the resultant wrapper executable.

-- N.B. you can also just put it in your PATH, which lets you refer to it simply 
-- as "clang-xcode5-wrapper" in GHC settings and "./configure --with-gcc=clang-xcode5-wrapper"
